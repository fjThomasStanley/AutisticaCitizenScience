Ellen has been busy tidying up GitHub this week with Georgia making it more usable.

Everything that is Fujitsu labelled in the issues list is added to the sprint board under the "to do" column.
A new column has also been added called "Backlog" during the call.
The intention is when any new user stories are added they will be placed in Backlog.
During Sprint planning the user stories will then be moved to the relevant column.
