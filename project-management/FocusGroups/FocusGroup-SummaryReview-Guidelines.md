# Focus group review guidelines

Thank you for helping us design and build a citizen science platform to learn from autistic people’s lived experience of navigating sensory environments.

This document contains guidelines for reading the summary of the focus group you participated in September or October 2019.
The summary has been sent to you in a separate document by email.

We estimate that reading the summary document will take up to two hours of your time.
We will pay all insight group member £30 to compensate them for this work.

You will be paid whether or not you ask us to make any changes.

If the process is confusing, or if you have any questions, please contact Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).
She can talk you through the summary document and take your feedback via phone call or Skype if you would prefer.

## What is the summary document?

We want to share the insights from our conversations to help others understand how they can best support the needs of autistic people with sensory processing differences.

The summary document is a collection of anonymised quotes from focus group participants.

## How was the summary document written?

The summary documents contain contents from discussions held during focus groups. The focus groups all followed the protocol for in-person discussion groups, as outlined in the [study protocol](project-management/A9_StudyProtocol.pdf)

The data collected from the focus groups was then processed in line with the in-person protocol outlined in [data management](project-management/A8_DataManagement.pdf)

### 1. Attend focus group <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Conversation_2041500.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Participants came to a focus group at Fujitsu to talk about a project to design a platform to use for autism research.

The focus group was recorded.

### 2. Transcribe discussion <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_transcript_532343.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The focus group was written down word-for-word. No personally identifying information was included in this process.

Personally identifying information includes:

* Names of individuals
* Precise ages
* Schools, workplaces, universities, and addresses

The recordings were then deleted.

### 3. Collect anonymised quotes <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Document_188540.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Quotations were taken from the document, shortened, and organised into groups based on common themes.

These insights are contained in the summary document  you have been sent.

## What happens next?

### 4. Review the summary document <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_Eye_2040041.png" width="150" align="right"/>

You have a chance to [review the summary document](Reviewing the summary document) and make changes.

We ask that you:

1. Understand the purpose of the document and what is going to happen with the insights.
2. Understand the information in the document.
3. Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised.
4. Send us any requested changes.

More information about how to review the document is available [below](#reviewing-the-summary-document).

### 5. Publish insights online <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_online_1632606.png" width="150" align="right"/>

The summary documents are published online at: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).

The quotes from the focus groups can be used by anyone and for any purpose.
Anyone using the information must credit the Autistica/Citizen Science community.

Potential users include:

* Future contributors to this project who want to add to the insights from the focus groups.
* Autism researchers and advocates who want to make sure they are serving the needs of autistic people.
* Parents, friends and colleagues who want to better understand how to support an autistic person they know.

**Anyone can read the quotes so it is important that you are comfortable having the information in the document be publicly available on the internet.**

### 6. Write down platform requirements <img src="../../images/noun-project-icons/noun_todolist_1128326.png" width="150" align="right"/>

Your suggestions are turned into a to-do list for the project team of researchers, developers, and designers, and for the wider community.

They will be used to help build the citizen science platform. 

We can't do everything, but we will try our best to follow your suggestions.

## Reviewing the summary document

Please review the summary document and make sure that you:

1. [Understand the purpose](#understand-the-purpose) of the document and what is going to happen with the insights.
2. [Understand the information](#understand-the-information) in the document.
3. [Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised](#ensure-the-information-is-appropriately-anonymised).
4. [Send us any requested changes](#send-us-any-requested-changes).

These steps are explained in more detail below.

### Understand the purpose

Please look through the summary document and let us know if there is anything you would like changed.

This is so that you can be sure we are using the information you give us in a way you know about and are comfortable with.

We will take out any of your own comments if you ask us to.

You can also ask us to change comments from you, or to include additional information.
These will be included in the published summary, with a note to explain that they were changed from the original summary.

If you do not understand the purpose of reviewing the summary document please contact Georgia at [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).
This is our first time running this process and we know it might be confusing!

### Understand the information

All the quotes in the summary document have been anonymised.
This means there is no personally identifying information associated with them.

However, we have kept some information about the speaker to make sure that the quotes are interpreted in an appropriate context.

People can be members of multiple groups: the **organisation** they work for, their **specialist role in the study**, their **connection to autism**, and their **connection to the experience** they are sharing.

For example:

* A quote from someone who is autistic and a parent of an autistic person speaking about an indirect experience would be identified as "**A P** `i`".
* A quote from someone who works at the Turing Institute and is a researcher and who is making a general comment would be identified as "_T_ R `g`".
* A quote from someone who works at Autistica and is a parent of an autistic person, and who is sharing a direct lived experience would be identified as "_A_ **P** `d`"

#### Organisation

Quotes from anyone employed by **Autistica**, **Fujitsu** or the **Alan Turing Institute** are marked with an italics capital letter:

* Autistica: _A_
* Fujitsu: _F_
* Turing: _T_

This tag is used to show which organisation the speaker is from.
Autistica is an autism research charity which funds the project and recruits members for the Insight Group.
Fujitsu is a tech company which has put together a development team to help the project and is offering free support.
The Turing is the UK's national institute for artificial intelligence and data science, and is funded to carry out the project.

#### Specialist Role on Project

Quotes from researchers paid to work on the project are marked with a capital letter:

* Researcher: R

#### Connection to Autism

Quotes from people with a personal connection to autism are marked with a bold capital letter:

* Autistic person: **A**
* Parent of an autistic person: **P**

#### Connection to Experience

Quotes can be in reference to direct or indirect experiences, or may be general comments.

* Direct experience or opinion of the speaker: `d`
* Indirect experience, one that was witnessed, reported, or inferred on behalf of someone else by the speaker: `i`
* General comment: `g`

The connection to the experience gives important information which might be needed to understand the comment.

For example, in the comment "she can tell every different flower apart by its scent - delightful", a parent of an autistic child might be speaking about their own delight that their child has such a skill (direct - `d`), or their child's delight at smelling the flowers (indirect - `i`).

A comment which is not attached to a specific experience or applies to everyone is tagged as `g`, for example, "people want lots of options".

### Ensure the information is appropriately anonymised

We are balancing our responsibility to not share personal information with our goal of being as transparent as possible, and of sharing valuable insights with the research community.

It is up to you how you decide if anything needs to be changed or taken out, but here are some things you might want to think about: 

1. Would you be happy for a stranger to read this comment?
2. Is there anything in this comment which would make it clear who you are to a stranger?
3. Is there anything in this comment which would make it clear to a family member, colleague, or friend that you are the speaker.
  If so, are you happy for them to read it? 
4. Is there anything in the comment which would allow other people to know that they are being spoken about?
  If so, are you happy for them to read it?
5. If you are writing about someone else, would they be happy for the comment to be public? If you can, ask them directly.

### Send us any requested changes

We hope that we have summarised your insights from the focus groups responsibly.

If we have done our job well, it should be hard to identify who said what in the summary document.

It is very important to us that you are comfortable with the information being made publicly available.

Please email [gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) with any changes you would like to be made to quotes in the document.

**Please reply in 2 weeks.**
You can ask for more time or to ask any questions about steps that are confusing.
