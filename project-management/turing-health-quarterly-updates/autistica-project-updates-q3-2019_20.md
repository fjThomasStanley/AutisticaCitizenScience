## Notable/substantive activity/outcomes in research progress

* This quarter we have made substantial progress transcribing the three focus group events held at Fujitsu’s offices in September 2019.
  The transcripts are approximately 60 pages long each.
  * Key quotes have been extracted from the transcripts and collated into insight documents.
    These documents will be reviewed by members of the focus groups to ensure their messages have been appropriately and sufficiently well anonymised.
  * The process for reviewing these insight documents has been developed through deep and very valuable engagement from autistic members of the project community.
  *	We project that this valuable dataset on autistic people’s priorities and requirements will be released under an open licence in March 2020.
* We held a productive workshop at the Turing Institute with the Fujitsu team on 18 November 2019 to map out working methods and to develop community co-creation strategies.
  We exchanged knowledge of GitHub collaboration and agile working.
  Future meetings are scheduled in January 2020 to further develop these collaborative ways of working.
* Georgia Aitkenhead circulated a full draft of position paper for the project in December 2019.
We received comments from key colleagues and will incorporate them into another version in early 2020.
We project this manuscript will be submitted for publication in March 2020.
* We would like to acknowledge and thank Turing facilities team member Otis Smith who continues to work with researchers.
  Otis provides valuable insights for the project, for example his efforts developing a categorisation system for contextualising autistic people's experiences.
* There were 3 pull requests created in this period, 2 of which were closed in the 3 months, and 15 new issues, 1 of which was closed in the 3 months.
* The team sent one newsletter in this period (November 2019) to 40 subscribers.

## Status of progress against goals/milestones, any blockers to progress

* Transcribing the focus groups and extracting the summary insights took longer than the project team had anticipated. 
  We are confident that the extra effort will be reflected in the final output.
* This project was affected by an 8 day strike by members of the University and College Union in November and December 2019.
  Kirstie Whitaker did not work from 25 Nov to 4 Dec 2019.
