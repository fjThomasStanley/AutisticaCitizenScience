## üëãüèΩ Part 1: Welcome & norm setting - 1 hour

| ----- | -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| 10:00 | Welcome | Overview of code of conduct and purpose of the session | **Kirstie** |
| 10:10 | Small group discussions | In breakout rooms discuss what norms you'd like to set for participatory co-creation with a diverse community, particularly (but not limited to) autistic people and their families | all |
| 10:25 | Report back | One person from each group share a summary of their conversation with the whole group | all |
| 10:40 | Think-pair-share | Individually reflect on the discussion for 2 minutes and then share those insights with a partner. Particular focus on anything that has been missed from the discussion so far | all |

### Guidelines for inclusive co-creation

#### Remote participation

* Please mute when you aren't speaking
* Remember that your keyboard is noisy when you're typing!

#### Group discussions

* Groups that are more diverse have better discussion
* See who is speaking in your group?
* Is someone having difficulty being heard?
* Aim to have a fair discussion, don't fixate on one argument
  * If having a disagreement when discussing your topic, take notes of both (multiple) arguments and move on!
* Changing groups after each session is totally fine

## üîó Useful resources: 

Simply secure has a great intro to wireframing: https://simplysecure.org/blog/wireframing-intro

A few good online wireframing tools:
* [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/feature/freehand) - very simple to use (just like drawing) and good for collaboration
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - A a few more features and prebuilt templates
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - more sophisticate option, would be good for working with designers.

Ethical design:
* [Ethical Design: The Practical Getting-Started Guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/ethical-design-practical-getting-started-guide/) - some useful things to keep in mind when designing, like particularly the 'best practices sections'
* [Ethic in UX design](https://usabilitygeek.com/ethics-in-user-experience-design/)
